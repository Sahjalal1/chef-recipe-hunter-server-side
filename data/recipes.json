This marinated meat sits on the bottom of the pot topped with half-cooked rice which is drizzled with saffron-infused water and more fried onions and fresh mint leaves. Sealed and slow-cooked in an oven or on stove-top to a delicious aromatic finger-licking biryani that you may serve with some kachumber, salad, and if you are like us, more pappadoms!"
